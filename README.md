# Design-Project-I: A design-focused, digitally accessible and minimalistic website. 

This is a project where I solely focused on designs. I learned advanced CSS deeply through this project. The main focus of this project was to make it accessible to 
everyone, make it smoothly responsive and follow the general convention of CSS. 

The main focus of this project was making it digitally accessible to everyone. I strongly believe that technology should be built with accessibility in mind. It makes 
the life of people with disabilities easier. Even small things like setting up the markup HTML in a way that can be understandable to a person with blindness matters a lot.

In this project, I practise using ems and rems instead of px or other units. I followed a minimalistic approach. I have followed the "mobile first" approach as it is
the best and the effective approach to do.
